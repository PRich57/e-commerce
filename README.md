# E-commerce

  ![404 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/No_License_Chosen-red)

## Description

  - The motivation for this project was to create the back end of an E-commerce application to better understand how popular E-commerce platforms operate.
  - I built this project to gain experience in creating the fundamental architecture of E-commerce applications, which have significant benefits to businesses and consumers alike.
  - This project solves the problem of having to go to the store to purchase consumer goods. Modern consumers prefer the efficiency of being able to make purchases online in the comfort of their own homes or while on the go during their busy lives.
  - I learned how to create associations between various tables and how to form some of these associations through a junction table. I also learned how sequelize can make the process of database synchronization, eager loading, associations, transactions, and database migrations safe from SQL injections while also reducing development time.

## Installation
  
  This project requires the use of node. Once node is installed, the user can use the command 'npm i' from the root directory to install the dependencies. To use this application to its fullest extent, the user should also have insomnia and MySQL installed for route testing and database usage.
  
## Usage
  
  To use this application, first be sure to create the database using schema.sql inside the db directory. This can be done via the MySQL workbench application or through the MySQL shell. Once the database has been created, the user should seed the database by going back to the VSCode terminal and entering the command 'npm run seed'. After the database has been successfully seeded, the user can open Insomnia to begin testing the various routes. Look at the routes created within the files in the routes directory for clarification on which routes can be tested. For further usage information please refer to the demonstration video by clicking the link in the description.
